# Hospital-Admission-System
This project is designed for Data Structures course at the university. The project is a hospital admission system, where emergency cases are admitted before non-emergency cases.
The hospital is represented by vectors for an application based on the data structures material,
and the waiting room is a priority queue, where the doctor sees the case and evaluates it and then enters it into the waiting room,
and then everyone in the waiting room is admitted to the hospital in order
